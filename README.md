```

### Configurable Default Username

YamlForge provides a configurable default username across all cloud providers for consistent SSH access:

**Default Behavior**: All instances use `cloud-user` as the default SSH username
**Customization**: Override in `defaults/core.yaml` or per-instance

```yaml
# defaults/core.yaml - Organization-wide setting
security:
  default_username: "cloud-user"  # Change to your preferred username
```

**Per-instance override example:**
```yaml
guid: "user1"

yamlforge:
  cloud_workspace:
    name: "custom-user-demo"
    description: "Custom username demonstration"
    
  instances:
    - name: "my-vm"
      provider: "aws"
      location: "us-east"
      flavor: "small"
      image: "RHEL9-latest"
      username: "my-custom-user"  # Instance-specific override
```

**Provider Support**:
- **AWS/Azure**: Automatically creates the user via user data scripts
- **GCP/OCI/IBM**: Native support, no additional scripts needed
- **All Providers**: Consistent SSH commands and outputs

See [Core Configuration Documentation](docs/configuration/core-configuration.md) for complete details.

‚Üí Preserves cluster and bastion, adds monitoring-server and database instances

Follow-up: "Make everything use the cheapest providers"
‚Üí Updates all components to use cost-optimized providers while maintaining functionality
```

**Training AI to Use YamlForge:**
Provide the AI with our JSON schema ([`docs/yamlforge-schema.json`](docs/yamlforge-schema.json)) and real examples from the `examples/` directory. Emphasize the required 5-character GUID, valid provider names, and exact field structure. See [AI Training Guide](docs/ai-training.md) for comprehensive training materials.

Use AI assistants to generate YamlForge configurations from natural language:

```bash
# Ask your AI assistant:
"Create a YamlForge YAML configuration for: 
'Production OpenShift cluster on AWS with monitoring and a sample web application'"

# AI generates valid YAML following our [schema](docs/yamlforge-schema.json)
# Save the output and analyze/deploy with YamlForge
python yamlforge.py ai-generated-config.yaml --analyze  # See what it will do
python yamlforge.py ai-generated-config.yaml -d output/ --auto-deploy  # Deploy it
## Real-World Scenarios

### Multi-Cloud Strategy
Deploy identical infrastructure across multiple clouds for redundancy and compliance:
```yaml
guid: "prod0"

yamlforge:
  cloud_workspace:
    name: "production-multi-cloud-{guid}"
    description: "Production deployment across multiple clouds"
  
  instances:
    - name: "app-aws-{guid}"
      provider: "aws"
      location: "us-east"
      flavor: "large"
      image: "RHEL9-latest"
    - name: "app-azure-{guid}"
      provider: "azure"
      location: "us-east"
      flavor: "large"
      image: "RHEL9-latest"
    - name: "app-gcp-{guid}"
      provider: "gcp"
      location: "us-east"
      flavor: "large"
      image: "RHEL9-latest"
```

### Cloud Migration
Seamlessly migrate workloads between cloud providers:
```yaml
guid: "mig01"

yamlforge:
  cloud_workspace:
    name: "migration-to-aws-{guid}"
    description: "Migrating from Azure to AWS"
  
  instances:
    - name: "migrated-app-{guid}"
      provider: "aws"  # Migrate from Azure to AWS
      location: "us-east"
      flavor: "medium"
      image: "RHEL9-latest"
```

### Flavor Mapping
No need to memorize provider-specific instance types! YamlForge automatically maps your CPU and memory requirements to the appropriate instance type for each cloud:

```yaml
guid: "flav0"

yamlforge:
  cloud_workspace:
    name: "flavor-mapping-{guid}"
    description: "Demonstrating CPU/memory to flavor mapping"
  
  instances:
    - name: "web-server-{guid}"
      provider: "aws"
      location: "us-east"
      cores: 2
      memory: 4096  # MB - YamlForge selects t3.medium automatically
      image: "RHEL9-latest"
    - name: "app-server-{guid}"
      provider: "azure"
      location: "us-east"
      cores: 4
      memory: 8192  # MB - YamlForge selects Standard_D2s_v3 automatically
      image: "RHEL9-latest"
    - name: "database-{guid}"
      provider: "gcp"
      location: "us-east"
      cores: 8
      memory: 16384  # MB - YamlForge selects e2-standard-8 automatically
      image: "RHEL9-latest"
```

**Instead of learning:**
- AWS: t3.micro, t3.small, t3.medium, m5.large, c5.xlarge...
- Azure: Standard_B1s, Standard_D2s_v3, Standard_E4s_v3...
- GCP: e2-micro, e2-small, e2-standard-8, n2-standard-4...

**Just specify:** `cores: 4, memory: 8192` and YamlForge handles the rest!

**Or use simple t-shirt sizing:**
```yaml
guid: "siz01"

yamlforge:
  cloud_workspace:
    name: "t-shirt-sizing-{guid}"
    description: "Using generic small/medium/large sizing"
  
  instances:
    - name: "web-server-{guid}"
      provider: "aws"
      location: "us-east"
      flavor: "small"  # Generic size - works on all clouds
      image: "RHEL9-latest"
    - name: "app-server-{guid}"
      provider: "azure"
      location: "us-east"
      flavor: "medium"  # Generic size - works on all clouds
      image: "RHEL9-latest"
    - name: "database-{guid}"
      provider: "gcp"
      location: "us-east"
      flavor: "large"  # Generic size - works on all clouds
      image: "RHEL9-latest"
```

**Available sizes:** `nano`, `micro`, `small`, `medium`, `large`, `xlarge`, `2xlarge`, `4xlarge`, `8xlarge`, `16xlarge`

### Instance Count and Scaling
Deploy multiple identical instances using the `count` field:

```yaml
guid: "scl01"

yamlforge:
  cloud_workspace:
    name: "scaling-demo-{guid}"
    description: "Instance scaling demonstration"
  
  instances:
    - name: "web-server-{guid}"
      provider: "aws"
      location: "us-east"
      flavor: "medium"
      image: "RHEL9-latest"
      count: 5  # Deploy 5 identical web servers
    
    - name: "worker-{guid}"
      provider: "gcp"
      location: "us-east"
      cores: 4
      memory: 8192
      image: "RHEL9-latest"
      count: 3  # Deploy 3 identical worker nodes
```

**Instance Naming**: When `count > 1`, instances are automatically named with suffixes:
- `web-server-scale1-1`, `web-server-scale1-2`, `web-server-scale1-3`, etc.
- Each instance gets identical configuration but unique names and resources

**Cost Analysis**: YamlForge automatically calculates total costs:
- Shows per-instance cost and total cost across all instances
- Includes count multipliers in cost summaries and analysis

### Provider Discounts

YamlForge supports configurable provider-specific discounts for accurate cost analysis in enterprise environments:

**Configuration Options:**
```yaml
# defaults/core.yaml - Organization-wide discounts
cost_analysis:
  provider_discounts:
    "aws": 10             # 10% enterprise agreement discount
    "azure": 20           # 20% EA discount  
    "gcp": 10             # 10% committed use discount
    "oci": 25             # 25% promotional discount
```

**Environment Variable Overrides:**
```bash
# Environment variables take precedence over core configuration
export YAMLFORGE_DISCOUNT_AWS=15        # 15% AWS discount
export YAMLFORGE_DISCOUNT_AZURE=20      # 20% Azure discount
export YAMLFORGE_DISCOUNT_GCP=10        # 10% GCP discount
export YAMLFORGE_DISCOUNT_OCI=25        # 25% OCI discount
export YAMLFORGE_DISCOUNT_IBM_VPC=18    # 18% IBM VPC discount
export YAMLFORGE_DISCOUNT_IBM_CLASSIC=12 # 12% IBM Classic discount
export YAMLFORGE_DISCOUNT_ALIBABA=30    # 30% Alibaba discount
export YAMLFORGE_DISCOUNT_VMWARE=5      # 5% VMware discount
```

**Features:**
- **Percentage-based**: Discounts specified as 0-100% 
- **Environment precedence**: Environment variables override core configuration
- **Cost analysis integration**: Applied to all cost displays and cheapest provider selection
- **Input validation**: Invalid values show warnings and default to 0%
- **Clear display**: Shows both original and discounted prices: `$0.0416/hour ‚Üí $0.0312/hour (25.0% discount)`

### Cost Optimization
YamlForge offers two intelligent cost optimization providers:

**`cheapest`** - General cost optimization for balanced workloads:
```yaml
guid: "cst01"

yamlforge:
  cloud_workspace:
    name: "cost-optimized-{guid}"
    description: "Automatically select cheapest provider"
  
  instances:
    - name: "api-server-{guid}"
      provider: "cheapest"  # Finds cheapest instance meeting CPU/memory requirements
      location: "us-east"
      flavor: "medium"  # Must specify size or cores/memory
      image: "RHEL9-latest"
    - name: "database-server-{guid}"
      provider: "cheapest"  # CPU/memory only - no GPU needed
      location: "us-east"
      cores: 4
      memory: 8192  # MB
      image: "RHEL9-latest"
    - name: "ml-training-{guid}"
      provider: "cheapest"  # Can also optimize GPU workloads with specs
      location: "us-east"
      cores: 8
      memory: 16384  # MB
      gpu_type: "NVIDIA V100"
      gpu_count: 1
      image: "RHEL9-latest"
    - name: "app-server-{guid}"
      provider: "cheapest"  # Combines t-shirt sizing with cost optimization
      location: "us-east"
      flavor: "large"  # Generic size - YamlForge finds cheapest "large" across all clouds
      image: "RHEL9-latest"
```

**`cheapest-gpu`** - Specialized GPU cost optimization:
```yaml
guid: "gpu01"

yamlforge:
  cloud_workspace:
    name: "gpu-optimized-{guid}"
    description: "Cheapest GPU instances across all clouds"
  
  instances:
    - name: "gpu-worker-{guid}"
      provider: "cheapest-gpu"  # Focuses purely on GPU cost, ignores CPU/memory
      location: "us-east"
      flavor: "medium"  # Basic flavor requirement
      gpu_type: "NVIDIA T4"  # Only GPU requirements needed
      gpu_count: 1
      image: "RHEL9-latest"
```

**Key Differences:**
- **`cheapest`**: Requires `size` or `cores`/`memory`, optimizes for overall cost
- **`cheapest-gpu`**: Only needs `gpu_type`/`gpu_count`, finds cheapest GPU regardless of CPU/memory

### Object Storage
Deploy native object storage buckets across all cloud providers with unified configuration:

```yaml
guid: "str01"

yamlforge:
  cloud_workspace:
    name: "multi-cloud-storage-{guid}"
    description: "Object storage across multiple clouds"
  
  storage:
    - name: "data-bucket-{guid}"
      provider: "aws"
      location: "us-east-1"
      public: false
      versioning: true
      encryption: true
      tags:
        Environment: "production"
        Project: "data-pipeline"
    
    - name: "backup-bucket-{guid}"
      provider: "azure"
      location: "us-east"  # Uses location mapping
      public: false
      versioning: false
      encryption: true
      tags:
        Environment: "production"
        Purpose: "backup"
    
    - name: "archive-bucket-{guid}"
      provider: "gcp"
      location: "us-central1"
      public: false
      versioning: true
      tags:
        Environment: "production"
        Purpose: "archive"
```

**Cost-Optimized Storage:**
```yaml
guid: "chp01"

yamlforge:
  cloud_workspace:
    name: "cost-optimized-storage-{guid}"
  
  storage:
    - name: "cheapest-bucket-{guid}"
      provider: "cheapest"  # Automatically selects cheapest provider
      location: "us-east"
      public: false
      versioning: true
      encryption: true
```

**Storage Features:**
- **Universal Configuration**: Same YAML works across AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage, OCI, IBM COS, and Alibaba OSS
- **Public/Private Access**: Simple boolean flag for public read access control
- **Versioning Support**: Enable object versioning for data protection
- **Encryption by Default**: Server-side encryption enabled automatically
- **Cost Optimization**: Use `cheapest` provider for automatic cost optimization
- **Tagging Support**: Consistent metadata across all providers
- **Location Mapping**: Use universal locations or direct cloud regions

### Enterprise OpenShift
Deploy OpenShift clusters optimized for each cloud's native capabilities:
```yaml
guid: "ocp01"

yamlforge:
  cloud_workspace:
    name: "enterprise-openshift-{guid}"
    description: "Enterprise OpenShift across clouds"
  
  openshift_clusters:
    - name: "aws-rosa-{guid}"
      type: "rosa-classic"
      location: "us-east"
      version: "4.18.19"
      flavor: "large"  # Cluster size (not instance size)
    - name: "azure-aro-{guid}"
      type: "aro"
      location: "us-east"
      version: "latest"
      flavor: "large"  # Cluster size (not instance size)
```

### Generic Images
Use the same image names across all cloud providers:
```yaml
guid: "img01"

yamlforge:
  cloud_workspace:
    name: "multi-os-deployment-{guid}"
    description: "Deploying different operating systems across clouds"
  
  instances:
    - name: "web-server-{guid}"
      provider: "aws"
      location: "us-east"
      flavor: "medium"
      image: "RHEL9-latest"  # Generic name - maps to provider-specific images
    - name: "app-server-{guid}"
      provider: "azure"
      location: "us-east"

```

### Generic Locations
Use simple region names that work across all cloud providers:
```yaml
# Instead of learning provider-specific regions:
# AWS: us-east-1, Azure: East US, GCP: us-east1, OCI: us-ashburn-1...

# Just use: "us-east" - YamlForge maps to the correct region for each provider
location: "us-east"  # Works on all clouds
```

## Universal Mappings

YamlForge uses generic names that work across all clouds. All mappings are customizable:

**Customizable Mappings:**
All mappings can be customized in the `mappings/` directory:
- `mappings/images.yaml` - Customize image mappings
- `mappings/locations.yaml` - Customize region mappings  
- `mappings/flavors/` - Customize instance type mappings
- `mappings/flavors_openshift/` - Customize OpenShift-specific mappings

**Unbiased and Transparent:**
YamlForge is not biased toward any specific operating system image or cloud provider. We only use information freely available on the internet to determine costs and make recommendations. Users can add their own operating system images in the `mappings/images.yaml` file to customize the available options for their deployments.
