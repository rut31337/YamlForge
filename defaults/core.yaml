# YamlForge Core Configuration
# Global settings that affect all deployments and provider behavior

# Provider Selection Configuration
provider_selection:
  # Providers to EXCLUDE from "cheapest" provider selection
  # This allows organizations to enforce compliance, security, or business policies
  exclude_from_cheapest:
    # Examples of common exclusions:
    - "vmware"      # Exclude on-premises VMware from cost comparisons
    - "alibaba"     # Exclude Alibaba Cloud for compliance reasons
    # - "oci"         # Exclude Oracle Cloud for security policies
    # - "ibm_classic" # Exclude IBM Classic infrastructure
    # []  # Empty list means all providers are considered

  # Provider priority order for tie-breaking in cost comparisons
  # When multiple providers have identical costs, prefer higher priority
  priority_order:
    - "ibm_classic"   # IBM Classic infrastructure
    - "ibm_vpc"       # IBM Cloud VPC
    - "gcp"           # Google Cloud Platform
    - "aws"           # Amazon Web Services
    - "azure"         # Microsoft Azure
    - "vmware"        # VMware vSphere (on-premises)
    - "oci"           # Oracle Cloud (often cheapest)
    - "alibaba"       # Alibaba Cloud (competitive in APAC)

# Cost Analysis Configuration
cost_analysis:
  # Default currency for cost calculations
  default_currency: "USD"
  
  # Regional cost adjustment factors (multipliers)
  # Some regions have different pricing due to local factors
  regional_cost_factors:
    # Asia-Pacific regions often have different pricing
    "cn-hangzhou": 0.85    # Alibaba Cloud China regions often cheaper
    "cn-shanghai": 0.85
    "cn-beijing": 0.85
    "ap-southeast-1": 1.05  # Singapore slightly more expensive
    "ap-northeast-1": 1.1   # Japan more expensive
    
  # Provider-specific cost factors (for on-premises or special pricing)
  provider_cost_factors:
    # VMware on-premises costs are highly variable, default conservative estimate
    "vmware": 0.8           # Assume 20% cheaper than cloud (amortized hardware)
    # Add organization-specific volume discounts here
    # "aws": 0.9            # 10% volume discount
    # "azure": 0.85         # 15% enterprise agreement discount

# Resource Tagging Defaults

  default_username: "cloud-user"
  
  # Default SSH public key for instances (can be overridden per provider)
  # This will be used if no ssh_public_key is specified in the YAML
  # Can also be set via SSH_PUBLIC_KEY or YAMLFORGE_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY environment variables
  default_ssh_public_key: ""
  
  # Auto-detect SSH keys from ~/.ssh/ directory (default: false)
  # When enabled, YamlForge will automatically look for id_ed25519.pub and id_rsa.pub
  # in the user's ~/.ssh/ directory if no explicit SSH key is provided
  auto_detect_ssh_keys: false
  
  # Default security group rules to ALWAYS include
  mandatory_security_rules:
    # SSH access (can be customized per organization)
    - protocol: "tcp"
      port: 22
      source: "10.0.0.0/8"     # Private networks only
