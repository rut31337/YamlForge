## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- YamlForge parent project (for schema validation and analysis)

### Installation

1. **Clone and navigate to DemoBuilder**:
   ```bash
   cd YamlForge/demobuilder
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:8501`

### First Use

1. **Describe your infrastructure**: 
   ```
   "I need 3 RHEL VMs on AWS in us-east with SSH and HTTP access"
   ```

2. **Review generated configuration**: DemoBuilder creates validated YAML automatically

3. **Analyze costs and providers**: See estimated costs and provider reasoning

```
"I need 1 large RHEL VM with NVIDIA T4 GPU for machine learning on AWS us-west"
```

### OpenShift Cluster
```
"Deploy a small ROSA cluster in us-east-1 for development"

## üéØ Workflow Stages

### 1. Requirements Gathering üìù
- Natural language input processing
- Infrastructure requirement extraction
- Provider preference detection

### 2. YAML Generation ‚öôÔ∏è
- Schema-compliant configuration creation
- Automatic field validation and correction
- Provider-specific optimization

### 3. Analysis üìä
- YamlForge `--analyze` execution
- Cost estimation and breakdown
- Provider selection reasoning

### 4. Refinement üîß (AI-Powered)
- **Context-Aware Modifications**: AI understands existing configuration and user intent
- **Natural Language Processing**: Handle requests like "add a bastion", "make it cheaper", "add monitoring"
- **Infrastructure Preservation**: Maintains existing resources while adding only requested changes
- **Smart Instance Naming**: Automatically generates meaningful names (bastion-host, web-server, database)
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate schema compliance checking and re-analysis

### 5. Completion ‚úÖ
- Final configuration download
- Dynamic cloud credential setup instructions (only for selected providers)
- Deployment guidance
- **Post-Approval Changes**: Continue making modifications even after approval - the system automatically returns to refinement mode while preserving the existing configuration

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Configuration Management

### Intelligent Modification Engine
DemoBuilder uses advanced AI to understand infrastructure contexts and user intentions without relying on static keyword matching:

**How It Works:**
1. **Context Analysis**: AI analyzes the existing YAML configuration structure
2. **Intent Recognition**: Natural language processing identifies what the user wants to change
3. **Preservation Logic**: AI maintains all existing infrastructure components
4. **Smart Addition**: New resources are added with contextually appropriate configurations
5. **Schema Validation**: All modifications are validated against YamlForge schema

**Example Conversation Flow:**
```
User: "Deploy a ROSA HCP cluster for development"
‚Üí AI generates YAML with ROSA HCP cluster configuration

User: "Add a bastion host for secure access"
‚Üí AI preserves the cluster, adds bastion-host instance with SSH configuration

User: "Add monitoring infrastructure and a database"
‚Üí AI adds monitoring-server and database instances while preserving existing resources

User: "Make everything use the cheapest providers"
‚Üí AI updates all components to use cost-optimized providers
```

**Advanced Capabilities:**
- **Semantic Understanding**: Recognizes intent behind phrases like "secure access", "monitoring", "database"
- **Configuration Continuity**: Maintains workspace names, GUIDs, and existing relationships
- **Provider Intelligence**: Understands cost optimization requests and provider-specific features
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of ambiguous requests with clarification prompts

## üîß Configuration

### Provider Management
Use the sidebar controls to enable/disable specific cloud providers. Default enabled providers are marked with ‚úÖ:

**Default Enabled Providers:**
- ‚úÖ Amazon Web Services (AWS) - GPU: ‚úÖ, OpenShift: ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Microsoft Azure - GPU: ‚úÖ, OpenShift: ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - GPU: ‚úÖ, OpenShift: ‚ùå
- ‚úÖ IBM Cloud VPC - GPU: ‚ùå, OpenShift: ‚ùå
- ‚úÖ IBM Cloud Classic - GPU: ‚ùå, OpenShift: ‚ùå
- ‚úÖ Container Native Virtualization (CNV) - GPU: ‚úÖ, OpenShift: ‚úÖ

**Additional Providers (disabled by default):**
- ‚¨ú Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) - GPU: ‚úÖ, OpenShift: ‚ùå
- ‚¨ú Alibaba Cloud - GPU: ‚úÖ, OpenShift: ‚ùå
- ‚¨ú VMware vSphere - GPU: ‚ùå, OpenShift: ‚ùå
- ‚¨ú Cost Optimized GPU - GPU: ‚úÖ, OpenShift: ‚ùå

### Cost Optimization
- **Manual cost optimization**: Users can request "cheapest" providers through natural language
- **GPU workload optimization**: Smart selection of `cheapest-gpu` for AI/ML workloads when requested
- **Provider-specific insights**: Cost comparisons and reasoning

## üß™ Example Conversations

### Development Environment
```
User: "Set up a development environment with 2 small RHEL VMs and SSH access"

DemoBuilder: "I've created a configuration with 2 small RHEL9 VMs using the cost-optimized provider. The configuration includes SSH access via security groups. Cost analysis shows $0.0624/hour total across both instances."

User: "Yes, and can you make them medium size instead?"

DemoBuilder: "I've updated the VMs to medium size and re-analyzed. The estimated cost is $0.1248/hour total for both medium instances. The configuration is ready for deployment!"

User: "Add an OpenShift HCP cluster to this setup"

DemoBuilder: "I've added a ROSA HCP cluster to your existing configuration. The cluster will be deployed alongside your VMs with an estimated additional cost of $0.8640/hour for the small cluster size."
```

### Production Workload
```
User: "I need a production setup with 1 large VM on AWS us-east-1 with HTTPS and SSH, plus a ROSA cluster"

DemoBuilder: "I've configured a large AWS instance in us-east-1 with security groups for HTTPS and SSH access, plus a ROSA classic cluster. This setup is production-ready. Would you like me to suggest any cost optimizations?"
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Schema Validation Errors**: DemoBuilder automatically fixes most schema issues. If persistent, check the generated YAML against `yamlforge-schema.json`.

**Analysis Failures**: Ensure YamlForge parent project is accessible. DemoBuilder falls back to subprocess calls if direct imports fail.

**Provider Not Available**: Check provider enablement in sidebar controls. Some providers may be disabled by default.

**YAML Generation Issues**: Try rephrasing requirements with more specific details (provider, region, size, etc.).

**OpenShift Cluster Addition**: If "add an openshift cluster" isn't working, try being more specific: "add a ROSA cluster" or "add a ROSA HCP cluster".

**Configuration Modifications**: The AI understands natural language - use phrases like "add a bastion host", "add monitoring infrastructure", "make it cheaper", or "add database servers". No specific keywords required.

**AI Modification Issues**: If the AI doesn't understand a modification request, try rephrasing with more context: instead of "add stuff", say "add monitoring and database infrastructure for a web application".
