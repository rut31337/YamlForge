# YamlForge Tests

This directory contains comprehensive test scripts for validating YamlForge functionality.

## Test Scripts

### `test_provider_initialization.py`
Tests that all cloud providers initialize correctly without warnings or missing file errors.

**What it tests:**
- YamlForgeConverter initialization
- All provider classes (AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM VPC/Classic, OCI, VMware, Alibaba, CNV, OpenShift)
- File path resolution for defaults and mappings
- No missing file warnings

**Usage:**
```bash
# From repository
python -m yamlforge.tests.test_provider_initialization

# From pip installation  
yamlforge-test-providers
```

### `test_terraform_generation.py`
Tests actual Terraform file generation for all major cloud providers.

**What it tests:**
- End-to-end Terraform generation workflow
- AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM VPC, IBM Classic providers
- YAML validation and processing
- File path resolution during Terraform generation
- Generated file validation

**Usage:**
```bash
# From repository
python -m yamlforge.tests.test_terraform_generation

# From pip installation
yamlforge-test-terraform
```

**Note:** This test uses `--no-credentials` mode, so no cloud authentication is required.

## Test Features

### Path Resolution Testing
Both tests validate that the centralized path resolution system works correctly:
- Repository mode (running from YamlForge directory)
- Developer mode (running from subdirectories)
- Package mode (pip installed packages)
- Environment variable override (YAMLFORGE_DATA_PATH)

### No Authentication Required
Tests are designed to run without cloud credentials:
- Provider initialization tests use analyze mode only
- Terraform generation tests use `--no-credentials` flag
- Tests focus on file resolution and code generation, not cloud connectivity

### Comprehensive Coverage
- **10 cloud providers** tested for initialization
- **5 major providers** tested for Terraform generation
- **All mapping files** validated (images, locations, flavors, defaults)
- **Error handling** and warning detection

## Expected Results

### Successful Run
```
ðŸš€ YAMLFORGE PROVIDER INITIALIZATION TEST
âœ… PASS AWS
âœ… PASS Azure
âœ… PASS GCP
âœ… PASS IBM VPC
âœ… PASS IBM Classic
âœ… PASS OCI
âœ… PASS VMware
âœ… PASS Alibaba
âœ… PASS CNV
âœ… PASS OpenShift
ðŸ“ˆ Results: 10 passed, 0 failed
ðŸŽ‰ ALL PROVIDERS PASSED!
```

### What Tests Validate
- âœ… No missing file errors
- âœ… No unnecessary warnings  
- âœ… Clean provider initialization
- âœ… Proper Terraform file generation
- âœ… Path resolution working across deployment modes
- âœ… Schema validation and YAML processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Import Errors**: Ensure you're running from the YamlForge root directory
2. **Missing Files**: Check that all mappings and defaults directories exist
3. **Permission Errors**: Ensure write access to `/tmp` for temporary test files

### Debug Mode
Add `--verbose` to see detailed output:
```bash
python tests/test_terraform_generation.py --verbose
```

## Execution Environment Usage

These tests are particularly useful for validating YamlForge in Ansible execution environments:

### In Execution Environments
```bash
# After installing yamlforge-infra package in EE
yamlforge-test-providers
yamlforge-test-terraform
```

### Benefits for EE Validation
- âœ… **Path Resolution Testing**: Validates that all defaults, mappings, and docs files are found via pip package resources
- âœ… **No External Dependencies**: Tests work without cloud credentials or network access
- âœ… **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests all 10 cloud providers and major functionality
- âœ… **Quick Validation**: Confirms YamlForge is properly installed and functional

### Typical EE Workflow
1. Build execution environment with yamlforge-infra package
2. Run `yamlforge-test-providers` to validate provider initialization
3. Run `yamlforge-test-terraform` to validate Terraform generation
4. Use YamlForge in Ansible playbooks with confidence

## Adding New Tests

When adding new providers or features:
1. Add provider tests to `test_provider_initialization.py`
2. Add Terraform generation tests to `test_terraform_generation.py`  
3. Update this README with new test descriptions
4. Ensure tests work in `--no-credentials` mode
5. Test console script entry points work from pip installations
