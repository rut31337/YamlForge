# YamlForge Core Configuration
# Global settings that affect all deployments and provider behavior

# Provider Selection Configuration
provider_selection:
  # Providers to EXCLUDE from "cheapest" provider selection
  # This allows organizations to enforce compliance, security, or business policies
  exclude_from_cheapest:
    # Examples of common exclusions:
    - "vmware"      # Exclude on-premises VMware from cost comparisons
    - "alibaba"     # Exclude Alibaba Cloud for compliance reasons
    # - "oci"         # Exclude Oracle Cloud for security policies
    # - "ibm_classic" # Exclude IBM Classic infrastructure
    # []  # Empty list means all providers are considered

  # Provider priority order for tie-breaking in cost comparisons
  # When multiple providers have identical costs, prefer higher priority
  priority_order:
    - "ibm_classic"   # IBM Classic infrastructure
    - "ibm_vpc"       # IBM Cloud VPC
    - "gcp"           # Google Cloud Platform
    - "aws"           # Amazon Web Services
    - "azure"         # Microsoft Azure
    - "vmware"        # VMware vSphere (on-premises)
    - "oci"           # Oracle Cloud (often cheapest)
    - "alibaba"       # Alibaba Cloud (competitive in APAC)
    - "cnv"           # Container Native Virtualization (KubeVirt)

# Cost Analysis Configuration
cost_analysis:
  # Default currency for cost calculations
  default_currency: "USD"
  
  # Regional cost adjustment factors (multipliers)
  # Some regions have different pricing due to local factors
  regional_cost_factors:
    # Asia-Pacific regions often have different pricing
    "cn-hangzhou": 0.85    # Alibaba Cloud China regions often cheaper
    "cn-shanghai": 0.85
    "cn-beijing": 0.85
    "ap-southeast-1": 1.05  # Singapore slightly more expensive
    "ap-northeast-1": 1.1   # Japan more expensive
    
  # Provider-specific cost factors (for on-premises or special pricing)
  provider_cost_factors:
    # VMware on-premises costs are highly variable, default conservative estimate
    "vmware": 0.8           # Assume 20% cheaper than cloud (amortized hardware)
    # Add organization-specific volume discounts here
    # "aws": 0.9            # 10% volume discount
    # "azure": 0.85         # 15% enterprise agreement discount
  
  # Provider-specific discount percentages (0-100)
  # These discounts are applied to displayed costs and analysis
  # Can be overridden by environment variables: YAMLFORGE_DISCOUNT_<PROVIDER>
  # Environment variables take precedence over this configuration
  provider_discounts:
    # Enterprise agreement discounts, volume pricing, special contracts
    "aws": 10             # 10% core config discount (can be overridden)
    # "azure": 20           # 20% EA discount  
    # "gcp": 10             # 10% committed use discount
    # "oci": 25             # 25% promotional discount
    # "ibm_vpc": 18         # 18% corporate agreement
    # "ibm_classic": 12     # 12% legacy infrastructure discount
    # "alibaba": 30         # 30% APAC regional discount
    # "vmware": 5           # 5% support contract discount
    #
    # Environment variable examples (take precedence over core config):
    #   export YAMLFORGE_DISCOUNT_AWS=15
