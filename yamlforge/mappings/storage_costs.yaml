# Cost calculation notes:
# - Costs are for standard storage tier
# - Includes base storage cost plus typical operation costs
# - Does not include data transfer costs (varies greatly by usage)
# - Versioning may increase costs 20-50% depending on change frequency
# - Encryption typically has no additional cost
# - Public buckets may have higher egress costs
